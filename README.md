# A Classic RPG Game (name to be determined)

## Description

Base Storyline: While out on an expedition with your partner you find yourself
in free fall. Before you know it you know it you're in a 50 feet deep
crevice. As your partner returns to town to gather rescue supplies, you
realize you are not alone. Surrounded by a horde of monsters you have no choice
but to fight until you are rescued, will you survive?

This is a classic Role-Playing Game in which users will select one of three
basic heroes to play as; mage, warrior, or archer. It is *round-based*, and the
user will take turns attacking the monsters. 
Each Hero will have *unique skills/traits* and access to a *basic inventory system*. 
Upon the end of each round users are able to *level up the abilities* of their 
characters. The world will be saved upon each round. 
User's may create up to three different worlds and have the option to delete 
them *permanently*. There will also be 3 difficulties that user's can choose from.

This game is for anyone who wants to relive the 2D RPG era of 
the 2000s. I chose to create this out of nostalgia and in honour of 
what I spent many of my childhood hours playing. The topic of 
Game Development has always piqued my interest, so I thought this would 
be a great opportunity to give it a shot.
